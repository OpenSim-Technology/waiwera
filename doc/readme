The user/ directory contains the user guide. To build the user guide, you need to have Sphinx installed (http://www.sphinx-doc.org). In the user/ directory, 'make html' will build the user guide as HTML pages, while 'make latexpdf' will build it as a PDF file.

The ford/ subdirectory contains developer documentation auto-generated by FORD.
